#' @title unListDS.o a serverside aggregate function called by ds.unList.o
#' @description Coerces an R object back from a list towards
#' the class it was before being coerced to a list 
#' @details Unlike most other class coercing functions this is
#' an aggregate function rather than an assign function. This
#' is because the {datashield.assign} function in opal deals specially with
#' a created object (newobj) if it is of class list. Reconfiguring the
#' function as an aggregate function works around this problem.
#' This aggregate function is based on the native R function {unlist}
#' and so additional information can be found in the help for {unlist}.
#' When an object is coerced to a list, depending
#' on the class of the original object some information may be lost. Thus,
#' for example, when a data.frame is coerced to a list information that
#' underpins the structure of the data.frame is lost and when it is
#' subject to the function {ds.unlist.o} it is returned to a simpler
#' class than data.frame eg 'numeric' (basically a numeric vector
#' containing all of the original data in all variables in the data.frame
#' but with no structure). If you wish to reconstruct the original
#' data.frame you therefore need to specify this structure again e.g.
#' the column names etc 
#' @param x.name the name of the input object to be coerced back from
#' class list. It must be specified in inverted commas. But this argument is
#' usually specified directly by <x.name> argument of the clientside function
#' {ds.unList.o}
#' @return the object specified by the <newobj> argument (or its default name
#' <x.name>.mat) which is written to the serverside.
#' In addition, two validity messages are returned. The first confirms an output
#' object has been created, the second states its class.
